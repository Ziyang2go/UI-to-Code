# UI to Code
Navigating arround Internet I found this cool series of posts called "[Can you code this UI concept?](https://stories.uplabs.com/can-you-code-this-ui-concept-9e4ba76b437e#.ucur0sn67)" by [UpLabs](https://www.uplabs.com) in which developers make designs come to life as prototypes. So inspired on that topic I made this repo to have fun and code some challenging UI concepts with HTML, CSS and Javasript(if necessary), I also will be pointing some of the tricks used in those challenges as a guide to everyone and a reminder for the future me.

### Concept 1: JUUCE App
This is a product card concept for IOS, It was found at UpLabs and the credit for the design is to [Sergii Petakh](https://dribbble.com/sergiipetakh). Here is the [Concept](https://ios.uplabs.com/posts/juuce-app-product-card-animation), here the [Pen](http://codepen.io/emoreno911/pen/vyJvpB) and here the [:books: Details](/juuce_app/README.md).
