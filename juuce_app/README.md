### Tricks
- **Sidebar transition**
	Theres two main divs for the layout [sidebar & content], the content div is over the sidebar so to obtain the desired animation just use the transform property to translate and scale the content.
- **App title gradient**
	Use the -webkit-background-clip property
- **Triangle div**

- **Background gradient transition**
	This is possible by using two divs(layers), the bottom one is a linear gradient from Black to White and the top layer has the color you like to show with the alpha set to 0.7 and the transition property setted for background-color.
- **Slider**
